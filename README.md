# Crop-Yield-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
The primary goal of this project is to synthesize disparate agricultural
datasets into a comprehensive and integrated dataset. By merging data
based on shared attributes such as 'Year' and 'Area', the project aims to
create a unified platform that captures the multifaceted nature of
agricultural systems. Subsequently, the project seeks to explore
correlations between different variables within the integrated dataset, such
as the impact of rainfall variability on crop yield or the relationship between
temperature fluctuations and pesticide efficacy. Through rigorous
statistical analysis and visualization techniques, it endeavours to extract
actionable insights that can inform decision-making processes in
agriculture. By empowering stakeholders with evidence-based
recommendations and predictive models, the project ultimately aims to
contribute to the optimization of farming practices, the mitigation of
environmental risks, and the promotion of sustainable agricultural
development.
